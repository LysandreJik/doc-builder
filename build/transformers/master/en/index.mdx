State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing for Jax, Pytorch and TensorFlow

🤗 Transformers (formerly known as _pytorch-transformers_ and _pytorch-pretrained-bert_) provides general-purpose
architectures (BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, XLM, DistilBert, XLNet...) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural
Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pretrained models in 100+ languages and deep interoperability between Jax,
PyTorch and TensorFlow.

This is the documentation of our repository [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). You can
also follow our [online course](https://huggingface.co/course) that teaches how to use this library, as well as the
other libraries developed by Hugging Face and the Hub.

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

- High performance on NLU and NLG tasks
- Low barrier to entry for educators and practitioners

State-of-the-art NLP for everyone:

- Deep learning researchers
- Hands-on practitioners
- AI/ML/NLP teachers and educators

Lower compute costs, smaller carbon footprint:

- Researchers can share trained models instead of always retraining
- Practitioners can reduce compute time and production costs
- 8 architectures with over 30 pretrained models, some in more than 100 languages

Choose the right framework for every part of a model's lifetime:

- Train state-of-the-art models in 3 lines of code
- Deep interoperability between Jax, Pytorch and TensorFlow models
- Move a single model between Jax/PyTorch/TensorFlow frameworks at will
- Seamlessly pick the right framework for training, evaluation, production

The support for Jax is still experimental (with a few models right now), expect to see it grow in the coming months!

[All the model checkpoints](https://huggingface.co/models) are seamlessly integrated from the huggingface.co [model
hub](https://huggingface.co) where they are uploaded directly by [users](https://huggingface.co/users) and
[organizations](https://huggingface.co/organizations).

Current number of checkpoints: <img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://huggingface.co/api/shields/models&color=brightgreen">

<h2 id="contents">Contents</h2>

The documentation is organized in five parts:

- **GET STARTED** contains a quick tour, the installation instructions and some useful information about our philosophy
  and a glossary.
- **USING 🤗 TRANSFORMERS** contains general tutorials on how to use the library.
- **ADVANCED GUIDES** contains more advanced guides that are more specific to a given script or part of the library.
- **RESEARCH** focuses on tutorials that have less to do with how to use the library but more about general research in
  transformers model
- **API** contains the documentation of each public class and function, grouped in:

  - **MAIN CLASSES** for the main classes exposing the important APIs of the library.
  - **MODELS** for the classes and functions related to each model implemented in the library.
  - **INTERNAL HELPERS** for the classes and functions we use internally.

The library currently contains Jax, PyTorch and Tensorflow implementations, pretrained model weights, usage scripts and
conversion utilities for the following models.

<h3 id="supported-frameworks">Supported frameworks</h3>

The table below represents the current support in the library for each of those models, whether they have a Python
tokenizer (called "slow"). A "fast" tokenizer backed by the 🤗 Tokenizers library, whether they have support in Jax (via
Flax), PyTorch, and/or TensorFlow.
